# UFOs

## Project Overview
With the work we did throughout the module, Dana's webpage has been working as intended, but she has asked us to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filer for multiple criteria at the same time.
Dana has asked us to provide filters suchs as:
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape
- Date

## Resources
Software: Java Script
Data: Data.js

## Results
Below I have some examples of the functioning filtering system for Dana's website. By selecting a filter, you can select certain subject to obtain a certain output. For example, we have the triangle filter for the shape below.

## Summary
Overall, the filtering system works efficiently. However, there is a drawback, which is case sensitivity. If you were to enter a state where you input a lower-case value, it would return with no output.
On the other hand, as far as recommendations go to increase productivity, I would recommend that the filters have a dropdown menu as opposed to entering data, as well as displaying a total vaule of records upon applying the filters.
